# WulinGate

[WulinGate](https://wulingate.com/en/): local and internet file sharing in your browser. Developed based on [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop)

## Main difference from original Snapdrop
* Using a 4-digits number as device name instead of two English words.
* Has internet transfer capability, which based on a 6-digits number room system. 
* The [website](https://www.wulingate.com/en/) using my own turn server instead of a public stun server, thus guaranteed transfer success rate in internet transfer situation and in complex network environment (public wifi, company network, etc.).
* Has a received messages list, which can show last 20 received messages. 


#### WulinGate is built with the following awesome technologies:
* Vanilla HTML5 / ES6 / CSS3 frontend
* [WebRTC](http://webrtc.org/) / [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend
